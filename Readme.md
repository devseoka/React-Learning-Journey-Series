# React UI Development Journey 🚀
At the start of this year, I made a big decision: it was time to break out of my Angular bubble and add another JavaScript UI framework to my toolkit. 🌐 You know, broaden the ol' developer horizons! And what did I pick?

👉 Next.js!

With my new venture all mapped out, I dove in, ready to level up... Only to realize I was in way over my head. 🤯

Turns out, jumping into a new framework without mastering the basics is like trying to run before you learn to crawl. Not ideal! 😂 So here I am, back to square one, embracing a fresh start and building a solid foundation from the ground up.

#### 💡 Lessons learned:

1. Skipping the fundamentals? Bad idea! 📉
2. Perseverance is key — and a bit of humor doesn’t hurt either! 😅

#### The Goal 🎯
Now, I'm fully committed to making sense of this whole Next.js thing — one step at a time, no skipping steps!

#### Join me on this journey, where I'm sure there will be:

1. Moments of triumph 🎉
2. Moments of confusion 🤔
3. And, undoubtedly, a lot of StackOverflow searches. 🔍
4. Let the journey to broaden my UI skills begin (again)! 😎
